## Course Description

This course examines electronic respository technologies from the perspective of indigenous and Maori tool-making traditions. Some more text should be written here. Text about electronics, for example, as well as indigenous concepts of electricity and energy flows. Other text would be good to fill in too: say, question about what are tools.
